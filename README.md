## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Cloudflare account (for deploying the worker)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd christmas-url-abb
   ```

2. **Install root dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Install worker dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../worker
   npm install
   ```

### Development

#### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or your Vite default port).

#### Worker Development

```bash
cd worker
npm run dev
```

This starts the Cloudflare Worker in development mode using Wrangler.

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:

```env
VITE_WORKER_API=https://your-worker-domain.workers.dev
```

## 🎨 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** - Modern React with latest features
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool and dev server
- **Emotion** - CSS-in-JS styling solution
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **React QR Code** - QR code generation
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icon library

### Backend
- **Cloudflare Workers** - Edge computing platform
- **Cloudflare KV** - Key-value storage for URL mappings
- **Wrangler** - Cloudflare Workers CLI tool

## 📦 Building for Production

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The production build will be in the `frontend/dist` directory.

### Deploy Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run deploy
```

This builds and deploys to GitHub Pages (if configured).

### Deploy Worker

```bash
cd worker
npm run deploy
```

Make sure to configure your `wrangler.toml` with your Cloudflare account details and KV namespace bindings.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **URL Shortening**: Users paste a long URL into the frontend interface
2. **API Request**: The frontend sends a POST request to the Cloudflare Worker `/shorten` endpoint
3. **Code Generation**: The worker generates a random 6-character code
4. **Storage**: The mapping between code and original URL is stored in Cloudflare KV
5. **Response**: The worker returns the shortened URL
6. **Redirection**: When someone visits the short URL, the worker looks up the original URL and redirects them

## 🎄 Christmas Magic Details

- **Snowflake Animation**: 40 animated snowflakes falling continuously across the page
- **Festive Color Scheme**: Warm golds, deep reds, and cozy beiges
- **Holiday Language**: All UI text uses Christmas and magical terminology
- **Smooth Animations**: Delightful transitions and hover effects throughout
- **QR Code Styling**: QR codes styled with festive colors and borders
